NAME: TODO LIST HERO (WIP) / Day to day Hero / 
"Make Life an Adventure!"

  This app will be a Daily To-Do list in the form of a fun mobile RPG. When you start up the app you make a character and then you set tasks for yourself which comprises of things you need to do during that day. 
You will also assign a "Level" for each task . IE EASY/ MEDIUM / HARD. Depending on the level of the task ... during completion you will earn more "Coins" respectively. For example , personally a group project at zipcode will be a hard task and an easy task for me would be packing my lunch for the day .The user will be able to use the coins to buy new clothes , weapons, accessories, etc to costumize their own RPG character. 
  
  The goal of this app is to keep the user organized and make them feel good about accomplishing their daily responsibilities. This app could be useful to a range of people like younger children in school , people with executive function disorder, or even people with depression who have a hard time doing smaller self care tasks such as getting out of bed, getting something to eat, etc.
